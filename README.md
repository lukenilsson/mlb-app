# README

- I used an API from MLB to collect data and display it in a basic scoreboard.
- Currently it only captures date, home/away teams, home/away scores, and venue.
- Clickable MLB icon takes you to MLB.com

- Future developments can include:
  - links to individual team pages
    - Season record, home vs away win rate
    - Player stats
  - MLB season record history
  - Player stats
  
 - Design with Rails with custom html / css
  - First time doing CSS with no bootstrap / tailwind.
